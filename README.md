# FinalProjectDMConsole
Final Project for Mobile Software Development
DMConsole is used for generating Non Playable Characters (NPCs) for the Dungeon Master (DM) to use in a table top role playing game (ttrpg). 
Starting the app or pressing the New List button generates a randomized scrollable list of 100 npc names. 
Clicking on a name will generate randomized details for that npc name.
